What Is MapReduce?
MapReduce is a way to process huge amounts of data quickly by breaking the work into smaller tasks and running them in parallel.

Think of it as an assembly line for data processing â€” it helps companies extract insights from massive datasets, like customer behavior, sales trends, or fraud detection.

ðŸ§° Real-World Analogy
Imagine you're organizing millions of survey responses to find out:

How many people like Product A

How many people like Product B

â€¦and so on

You wouldnâ€™t read all the responses yourself. Instead, you'd:

Split the job among 100 interns (Map)

Each intern counts their chunk of responses

You combine their results into one final report (Reduce)

Thatâ€™s MapReduce:

Map â†’ Break down the data and process pieces in parallel

Reduce â†’ Combine results to get final insights
